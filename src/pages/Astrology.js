                <p>Astrology is an ancient science which helps us improve our karma by telling us what our destiny is going to be. It is not that we are consigned to accept bad situations in life; Astrology is a kind of tool to help us correct and resurrect our Life through Good deeds. Astrology is the science of gaining proficiency over deed &amp; time management which helps us manage our life in a better way.</p>
                <p>By analysing the horoscope and understanding the dharma, artha, kama and moksha, one can gains insight into the individual’s basic instincts. He would also be able to suggest a better lifestyle and spiritual sadhana. The three gunas—sattva, rajas and tamas coexist in a varying degree of influence that is also understood from the chart. The gunas suggest the nature of all ones thoughts, feelings and actions, so the sadhana is suggested accordingly. For example, Sativ, Rajasic, Tamasic persons are suggested yoga and meditation, devotion, Selfless service respectively.</p>
                <p>It is just the knowledge of karma which helps the individual take ownership for the circumstances in which he finds himself and let go of resentment at the misfortunes indicated in the chart which is a mere messenger of one’s karma or in other word an opportunity to correct one’s life.</p>
                <p>Vedic astrology is based on mathematical divisions of the zodiac and defined relationships between planetary locations. The zodiac is a fine band across the sky through which the sun, moon and planets travel, expressing various influences, both physical and subtle. The main zodiac division used is made of twelve signs, or rashis, of 30 degrees each.</p>
                <p><b>Lagna</b></p>
                <p>The Earth rotates at about one sign every two hours, causing the signs and planets in them to rise in the east and set in the west. The point of the sign rising in the east forms the cusp of the first house (bhava). This is the ascendant, rising sign or lagna, which determines the orientation of the chart as a whole. </p>
                <p><b>Navagraha</b></p>
                <p>Navagraha are nine heavenly bodies (as well as deities) that affects human life as per vedic astrology. The term is derived from nava ("nine") and Graha (planet). 
                    </p><p>The Navaraghas are:-</p>
